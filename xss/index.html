<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Below you have access to three, vulnerable applications.
They differ in the data access layer. There are some user accounts prepared:
<ul>
    <li>`bach:haslo`</li>
    <li>`john:snow`</li>
    <li>`bob:bob`</li>
    <li>`user*:pass` where `*` is from `1` to `29`</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>After successful authentication
each user is presented with a page showing a list of user's messages and
a form for adding a new one. Try to fiddle with the form to see what can
you make it do. In general, user can only add a message as themselves. But
is it so? Try it!

There is also an API endpoint for searching user's messages: api/post
The endpoint needs a username, a password and a message identifier (index).
The data can be provided either in a query string or in a request body
(in JSON format). If the username/password pair is incorrect it will result
in `Forbidden` response. If the correctly authenticated user has no message
with the provided identifier (index), the response is `Nothing`. It DOES NOT
mean that NO OTHER user has a message with this identifier. Message identifiers
are unique in the whole table and are not visible at the moment in the application.
So you can try guessing.</p>

<h1>Applications</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="/kv">with Redis backend</a></li>
<li><a href="/sql">with MySQL backend</a></li>
<li><a href="/nosql">with MongoDB backend</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Endpoints</h1>
Each application has the same number of endpoints:
<ul>
    <li> /&lt;app&gt;/auth/ [POST] [form-data]
        receives the form data from the login form and then redirects the user,
        returning a cookie with a session identifier;
    </li>
    <li> /&lt;app&gt;/auth/login [GET]
        presents a login form;
    </li>
    <li> /&lt;app&gt;/posts/ [POST]
        save the post message for the currently logged user;
    </li>
    <li> /&lt;app&gt;/api/post [GET] [url-encoded, json]
        returns the post owned by the user identified by the username/pair provided;
        if the username/password pair is invalid, `Forbidden` is returned;
        if the correct user has no message with the given index, `Nothing` is returned;

        Example: GET /&lt;app&gt;/api/post?username=bach&password=haslo&index=1
    </li>
</ul>
