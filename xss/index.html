<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Below you have access to three, vulnerable applications.
They differ in the data access layer. You can log-in to three users:
`bach:haslo`, `john:snow` and `bob:bob`. After successful authentication
each user is presented with a page showing a list of user's messages and
a form for adding a new one. Try to fiddle with the form to see what can
you make it do. In general, user can only add a message as themselves.
But, there is an API endpoint for searching user's messages. The endpoint
needs a username and a message identifier. The data can be provided either
in a query string or in a request body (in JSON format).</p>
